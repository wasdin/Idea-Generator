This is a simple JavaScript utility to generate ideas for story writers, at the suggestion and with help from my wonderful writing wife.

You can view a live version here: http://wasdin.net/jake/idea-generator/generator.html

It is written in "pure" JavaScript, except that I am using a Python script to generate arrays from text files, which is also in the repository.
